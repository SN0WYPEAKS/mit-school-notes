chapter 3.1 exhaustive enumeration:
    exhaustive enumeration:
        means to go through all possible solutions until finding the right answer or we
        exhaust the space of possibilities
    decrementing function:
        this is a function that has the following properties:
            it maps a set of program variables into an integer
            when the loop is entered, its values is nonnegative
            when its value is <=0, the loop terminates
            its value is decreased every time through the loop
    guess and check:
        a method to "guess" the answer then check to see if it satisfies the constraints
