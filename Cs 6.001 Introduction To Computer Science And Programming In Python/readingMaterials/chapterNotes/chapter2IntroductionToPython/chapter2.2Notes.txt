CHAPTER 2.2 BRANCHING PROGRAMS:
    STRAIGHT-LINE PROGRAMS:
        execute one statement after another in the order in which they appear,
        and stop when they run out of statements
    BRANCHING PROGRAMS:
        SIMPLEST BRANCHING PROGRAM IS A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT:
            CONDITIONALS HAVE THREE PARTS:
                a test, i.e., an expression that evaluates to either true or false
                a block of code that is executed if the test evaluates to true;
                and an optional block that is executed if the test is false
            conditionals are "if else" statements
        indentation is semantically meaningful in python
        NESTED CONDITIONALS:
            when either the true block or the false block of a conditional
            contains another conditional
        PROGRAM RUNS IN CONSTANT TIME:
            a program for which the maximum running time is bounded by the
            length of the program
        COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY:
            the study of the intrinsic difficulty of problems
