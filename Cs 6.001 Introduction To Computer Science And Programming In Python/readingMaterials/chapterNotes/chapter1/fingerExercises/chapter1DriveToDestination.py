# Finger Exercise: Computers can be annoyingly literal.
# If you donâ€™t tell them exactly what you want them to do,
# they are likely to do the wrong thing.  Try writing an
# algorithm for driving between two destinations.  Write
# it the way you would for a person, and then imagine
# what would happen if that person executed the
# algorithm exactly as written. For example, how many
# traffic tickets might they get?
