CHAPTER 2.3 STRINGS AND INPUT:
    THE OPERATOR + IS SAID TO BE OVERLOADED:
        it has different meanings depending upon the types of the objects to which it is
        applied
        it means addition when applied to two numbers
        and concatenation when applied to two strings
    THE OPERATOR * IS ALSO OVERLOADED:
        it means multiplication when used on two numbers
        when applied to an int and a string, it duplicates the string equal to the int
    TYPE CHECKING:
        it turns careless(and sometimes subtle) mistakes into errors that stop execution,
        rather than errors that lead programs to behave in mysterious ways
    LENGTH(LEN):
        this function can be used to find the length of a string
    INDEXING:
        can be used to extract individual characters from a string. in python all
        indexing is zero based(the count starts at zero not one)
    SLICING:
        is used to extract substrings of arbitrary length. if s is a string, the
        expression s[start:end] denotes the substring of s that starts at index
        start and ends at index end-1
        for example, 'abc'[1:3] = 'bc'
        why does it end index end-1 rather than end? so that expressions such as
        'abc'[0:len('abc')] have the value one might expect
        if the value before the colon is omitted, it defaults to 0
        if the value after the colon is omitted, it defaults to the length of the string
CHAPTER 2.3.1 INPUT:
    TYPE CONVERSIONS(TYPE CASTS):
        the process of converting one type to another
