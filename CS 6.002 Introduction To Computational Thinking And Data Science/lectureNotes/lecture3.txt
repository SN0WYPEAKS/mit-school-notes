notes from the lecture:
    talking about graphs and shortest path problems
    only graphs on the board, so I can't write them here

definition for title subjects:
    graph-theoretic models:
        A graph is comprised of a set of nodes, also referred to as vertices,
        along with a set of either edges or arcs which connect pairs of nodes.
        Used to identify mechanisms at steady state, starting from a global reaction.
