notes from the lecture:
    why random walks?:
        random walks are important in many domains:
            understanding the stock market(maybe)
            modeling diffusion processes
            Etc.
        good illustration of how to use simulations to understand things
        excuse to cover some important programming topics:
            practice with classes
            practice with plotting
    pythagorean theorem:
        c**2 = a**2 + b**2
    the drunk class in the code is called a base class.
    it is not supposed to be useful on its own.
    it must be inherited
    when working with simulations, you must run a sanity check to test accuracy
    sanity check:
        testing the simulation with already known values
        a very brief run-through of the functionality of a computer program,
        system, calculation, or other analysis,
        to assure that part of the system or methodology works roughly as expected

subject title definitions:
    random walks simulations:
        a random process that describes a path that consists of
        a succession of random steps on some mathematical space
