lecture notes:
    linear spring:
        amount of force needed to stretch or compress spring
        is linear in the distance the spring is stretched
        or compressed
        each spring has a spring constant, k, that determines
        how much force is needed
    hooke's law of elasticity:
        the strain of the material is proportional to the
        applied stress within the elastic limit of that material
            F = -kd
            if a spring has a spring constant of 35,000 newtons
            how much does a rider have to weigh to compress
            the spring by one centimeter
            F=0.01m*35,000N/m
            F=350N
            F=mass*acc
            F=mass*9.8m per second squared which is the acceleration
            of gravity
            mass*9.8m/s2=350N
            mass=350N/9.81m/s2
            mass=350k/9.81 the k refers to kilograms, not the
            spring constant
            mass=35.68k or 79lbs
        there is a limit to the amount of force the law can hold
        before the spring breaks down
    finding k (spring constant):
        F=-kd       F = force
        k=-F/d      d = distance
        k=9.81*m/d  m = mass
    measuring distance:
        which should we choose?:
            x-axis, y-axis, or perpendicular to the line?
            Vertical distance because we want to predict
            dependent Y value for given independent X value,
            and vertical distance measures error in that prediction
    least squares objective function:
        representing the sum of squared differences between
        measurements stored in an experimental data file and a
        corresponding expression evaluated in the COMSOL Multiphysics model
        y = mx + b and y = a + bx
        In a least-squares regression for y = mx + b,
        m = N ∑ ( x y ) − ∑ x ∑ y N ∑ ( x 2 ) − ( ∑ x ) 2 and b = ∑ y − m ∑ x N,
        where N is the number of data points, while x and y are the
        coordinates of the data points.

title subject definitions:
    experimental data:
        collected through active intervention by the researcher
        to produce and measure change or to create difference
        when a variable is altered
