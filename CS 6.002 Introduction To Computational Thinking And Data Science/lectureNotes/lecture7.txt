notes from the lecture:
    mean:
        the average number; found by adding all data points
        and dividing by the number of data points
    standard deviation(sigma):
        a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean
    normal distribution:
        data is symmetrically distributed with now skew
        a data set (when graphed) must follow a bell-shaped
        symmetrical curve centered around the mean
    probability density functions(PDFs):
        basic function (PDF) for normal distribution:
            def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
                factor1 = (1.0/(sigma*((2*pylab.pi)**0.5)))
                factor2 = pylab.e**-(((x-mu)**2)/(2*sigma**2))
                return factor1*factor2
    densities:
        derivative of cumulative distribution function
    derivative in math:
        the rate of change of a function, or the slope of the tangent line
        at a particular point on a function
    Digressing from the lesson to discuss useful tools:
        SciPy:
            library contains useful mathematical functions used by scientists and engineers
            scipy.integrate.quad has up to four arguments:
                a function or method to be integrated
                a number representing the lower limit of the integration,
                a number representing the upper limit of the integration,
                and an optional tuple supplying values for all arguments, except the first,
                of the function to be integrated
            scipy.integrate.quad returns a tuple:
                approximation to result
                estimate of absolute error
    the central limit theorem(CLT):
        1. the means of the samples in a set of samples
            (the sample means) will be approximately normally distributed,
        2. this normal distribution will have a mean close
            to the mean of the population, and
        3. the variance of the sample means will be close
            to the variance of the population divided by the sample size
    is it correct to state(from our simulations to find pi):
        95% of the time we run this simulation, we will estimate
        that the value of pi is between 3.13743875875 and 3.14567467875?:
            yes
        with a probability of 0.95 the actual value of pi
        is between 3.13743875875 and 3.14567467875?
            yes
        both are factually correct
        but only the first of these statements can be inferred from our simulation

definition of title subjects:
    confidence intervals:
        a range of values that describes
        the uncertainty surrounding an estimate
        (a range of values so defined that there is a specified probability
        that the value of a parameter lies within it)
