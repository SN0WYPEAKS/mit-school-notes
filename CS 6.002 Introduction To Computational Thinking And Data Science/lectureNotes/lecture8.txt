notes from the lecture:
    recall inferential statistics:
        inferential statistics:
            making inferences about populations by examining one or more
            random samples drawn from that population
        with monte carlos simulation we can generate lots of random samples,
        and use them to compute confidence intervals
        but suppose we can't create samples by simulation:
            "according to the most recent poll Clinton(a corrupt piece of crap)
            leads Trump(who beat Clinton luckily)
            by 3.2 percentage points in swing states. the registered voter sample
            is 836 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points." - October 2016
    probability sampling:
        each member of the population has a nonzero probability of being included in a sample
    simple random sampling:
        each member has an equal chance of being chosen
    stratified sampling:
        a type of sampling method in which the total population is divided
        into smaller groups or strata to complete the sampling process
    new in code:
        numpy.std:
            a function in the numpy module that returns the standard deviation
        random.sample(population, sampleSize):
            returns a list containing sampleSize
            randomly chosen distinct elements of population
            sampling without replacement
        pylab.axvline(x = popMean, color = 'r'):
            draws a red vertical line at popMean on the x-axis
            there's also a pylab.axhline function for horizontal lines
        pylab.errorbar(xVals, sizeMeans,
                       yerr = 1.96*pylab.array(sizeSDs),
                       fmt = 'o'
                       label = '95% Confidence Interval')
    standard error of the mean:
        def sem(popSD, sampleSize):
            return popSD/sampleSize**0.5

definition of title subjects:
    sampling:
        selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research
    standard error:
        indicates how different the population mean is likely to be from a sample mean
