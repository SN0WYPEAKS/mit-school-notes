notes on the board:
    class:
        template for data type
        cluster date:
            modularity/abstraction
            &methods
        data hiding:
            only access the parts through a method
            python doesn't enforce this
        class is used to make instances:
            attributes
    method:
        __init__    creates instance
        __cmp__     comparison
        __str__     printed representation
    shadowing(overriding):
        override methods
    ug > per
    ug.__cmp__(per)
    for p in course6:
        print(p.family_name())
    __iter__:
        next
    encapsulation:
        data hiding
    inheritance
    hierarchy of classes

definitions of the subject title:
    encapsulation:
        a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object,
        so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.
    inheritance:
        a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class
    shadowing:
        when a variable declared within a certain scope(decision block, method, or inner class)
        has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope.
        If the scope you are in has a method with the same name as a class it inherits from,
        it has priority over an inherited method.
