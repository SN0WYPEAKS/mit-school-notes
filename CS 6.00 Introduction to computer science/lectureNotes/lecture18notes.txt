notes on the board:
    structure of the simulations we are using:
        1:
            inner loop that simulates one trial
        2:
            "enclose" the inner loop in another loop
            that conducts an appropriate number of trials
        3:
            calculate and present some relevant statistics about the trials
    label axis - and look while running it
    ask if the answer makes sense
    ask if it is consistent with other evidence
    by systematic about debugging
    debug with a simple example that you already know the answer to
    brownian motion:
        a random movement of microscopic particles suspended in liquids or gases
        resulting from the impact of molecules of the fluid surrounding the particles

definition of title subjects:
    presenting simulation results:
        use effective visualizations that show your data, your model, and your analysis
    pylab:
        a module that provides a Matlab like namespace by importing functions from the modules NumPy and Matplotlib
    plotting:
        used to draw points(markers) in a diagram
