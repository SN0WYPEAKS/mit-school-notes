notes on the board:
    data enhancement(extrapolate)
    texas sharpshooter fallacy:
        shooting randomly at a barn and drawing bulls-eyes over the holes
    446 anorexic women interviewed:
        (30% more than average were born in June)
        48 3%
        answered the wrong question
        lurking variables
    stockmarket simulation:
        indexed portfolio: 
            you want to own all the stocks in the market
            if the stock market goes up or down your money follows it
            don't require a lot of thought
            low expense ratio because you don't need to pay anyone to find the best stocks to invest in
        managed portfolio:
            you hire someone smart to pick winning stocks to invest in
        efficient market hypothesis:
            asserts that markets are informationally efficient:
                current prices reflect all publicly known information about each stock(un-biased)
                tomorrow it is just as likely to go up or down relative to the market
        stock & market:
            adjusted for risk
        distribution
        multiplicative vs additive
        memoryless (poisson):
            past behavior has no bearing on future behavior
