Notes written on the board:
    Goals for this class:
        Think like a computer scientist
        What is computation:
            the action of mathematical calculation
        declarative knowledge:
            States a fact without explaining it or the process to find it
            sqrt(x) is that y such that y**2 equals x
            y is positive
        imperative knowledge:
            Explains the process of finding an answer
            start guess G
            if G**2 is close enough to x, stop and return G
            else new guess = G + x over G divided by 2 repeat until a close enough answer is found
        fixed program computers:
            computers that are built for one specific function:
                calculators - makes calculations
                Atanasoff(1941) - solves linear equations
                Turing bombe - designed to break codes
        stored-program computer:
            you can provide the computer a sequence of instructions describing the process you want it to execute:
                modern computers
        Help that python gives with syntax errors:
            Syntax - what are legal expressions:
                "cat dog boy" Lots of help
                least worrysome bugs
            Static semantics - what programs are meaningful
                "My desk is Susan" Some help
                most bothersome bugs
            Semantics - what does the program mean:
                what's going to happen when the program runs

definition of the subjects in the lesson title:
    data types:
        the classification or categorization of data items
    operators:
        special symbols that perform operations on variables and values
    variables:
        containers for storing data values
