        location
        compass point
        field
        drunk
        psuedo random
        make sense ofdata

        python allows default values for parameters

definitions of the subjects in the lesson title:
    computational models:
        the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics, and computer science
    random walk simulation:
        a random process in which a token or a marker is randomly moved around some space
