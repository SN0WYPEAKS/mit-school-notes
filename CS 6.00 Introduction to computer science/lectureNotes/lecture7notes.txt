notes on the board:
    Ivys[1] = -15
    L1(list 1) points to a list 1,2,3
    L2 = L1 will make L2 point to the same object as L1 so if anything is changed in L1, it will change in L2 as well
    a = 1
    b = a
    a = 2
    these assignments are immutable, so b will still point to 1 even if a is assigned to something else
    dictionaries:
        mutable
        not ordered
        generalized indexing
        elements in dictionaries are key value pairs <key, value>
    key value pairs:
        a data type that includes two pieces of data that have a set of associated values and a group of key identifiers
    hashing:
        the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value
    pseudocode for computing the length of a hypotenus of a right triangle:
        input value for the base as a float
        find the height
        find the square root of b**2 + h**2
        save as a float in hyp(hypotenus)
        print out the answer using the value in hyp
    efficiency:
        orders of growth
        choice of algorithm
        map problem into class of algorithms
        space and time
        how much memory do i need to complete a computation
        what is the number of basic steps needed as a function of input size
    random access model:
        best case min
        worst case max
        expected case avg

definitions for lesson title subjects:
    lists:
        a sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name
    mutability:
        a mutable object can be changed after it's created
    dictionaries:
        an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs
    introduction to efficiency:
        a broad term used to depict the reliability, speed and programming methodology used in developing codes for an application
