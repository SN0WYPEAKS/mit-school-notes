notes on the board:
    totally ordered:
        anything on the left is smaller than what is on the right
    regression testing:
        a type of testing in the software development cycle that runs after every change to ensure that the change introduces no unintended breaks
    the square root of 0.25 is 0.5
    speed of convergence:
        the speed of the error as we approach the root
    finding the root:
        sqrt(x)
        f(guess) = guess**2 - x
        f(guess) = 0
    dy/dx
    f(guessi) = 2 * guessi
        guessi + 1 = guessi - f(guessi)/2*guessi
    f(3) = 9 - 16 = -7
    guessi + 1 = 3 - (-7/6) = 4.1666
    answers can be wrong
    if there are many ones in a row, be suspicious and paranoid
    non-scalar types:
        tuples()
        strings
        both immutable
    mutable types:
        lists[]
        Techs = ['MIT', 'Cal Tech']
        Techs ==> 'MIT'|'Cal Tech'
        Ivys = ['Harvard', 'Yale', 'Brown']
        Ivys ==> 'Harvard'|'Yale'|'Brown'
        Univs = []
        Univs ==>
        Univs.append(Techs)
    methods:
        fancy name for function with a different syntax
    flatten the list:
        instead of using append, use the concatenate operator

definition of the subjects in the lesson title:
    bisection methods:
        an approximation method to find the roots of the given equation by repeatedly dividing the interval
    newton/raphson:
        a way to quickly find a good approximation for the root of a real-valued function
        faster and more accurate than bisection
    introduction to lists:
        a sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name
