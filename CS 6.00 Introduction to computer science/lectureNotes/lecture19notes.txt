notes on the board:
    biased random walks
    polymorphism:
        the provision of a single interface to entities of different types, or the use of a single symbol to represent muyltiple different types
    distribution of the data:
        tells information about how many people end up where rather than just the averages
    normal(Gaussian)distribution:
        a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean,
        showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence
        than data far from the mean
    manhattan project:
        an unprecedented, top-secret world war 2 government program
        in which the United States rushed to develop and deploy
        the world's first atomic weapons before nazi germany
    monte carlo simulation:
        a mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event
    generate a sample of representative scenarios
    simulations are like experimental devices
    simulations are typically descriptive not prescriptive:
        describe situations they don't tell the solution
    optimization algorithm is descriptive:
        gives the best possible solution

definitions for title subjects:
    biased random walks simulation:
        a time path process in which an evolving variable
        jumps from its current state to one of various potential new states
    distributions:
        a method of simulating the variations that occur in timing
        (and other numbers)
        in any process involving people or machines or anything in nature
