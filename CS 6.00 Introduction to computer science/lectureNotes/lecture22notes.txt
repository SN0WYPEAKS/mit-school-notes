notes on the board:
    fitting old values does not equal "new"
    distribution:
        normal(gaussian, bell curve, natural, stable):
            mean:
                the mean is zero
            standard deviation(statistical dispersion):
                the standard deviation is 1
            empirical rule for normal distributions:
                68% within 1
                95% within 2
                99.7% within 3
        uniform:
            each value in the range is equally likely
    things to beware of with data:
        0. Beware of people who give properties of data, but not data
        1. (cum hoc ergo propter hoc) with this therefore because of this (correlation does not equal causation)
        2. beware of non-response bias(non-representative samples)
        3. beware data enhancement(reading more into the data than it actually implies) place the data in context

definitions for title subjects:
    normal distributions:
        continuous probability distribution wherein values lie in a symmetrical fashion
        mostly situated around the mean
    uniform distributions:
        a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely
    exponential distributions:
        a continuous probability distribution that often concerns
        the amount of time until some specific event happens
