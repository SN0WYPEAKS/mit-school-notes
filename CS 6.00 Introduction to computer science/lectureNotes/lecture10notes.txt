notes on the board:
    search:
        ordered list - binary search(log n)         unordered list - linear O(n)
        n log n - to get ordered?
        n log n + log n                             amortize
        n log n + klogn                               kn searches
    divide and conquer algorithm:
        split the problem into several subproblems of the same type
        solve independently
        combine solutions
    merge sort:(invented in 1945 by Jon Von Neumann)
        merge two sorted lists
        [3,12,17,24]    [1,7,4,30]
        1<3, 2<3, 3<4, 4<12, 12<30, 17<30, 24<30
        [1,2,3,4,12,17,24,30]
        7 comparisons
        O(n) n - sum of the number of elements in each list
        divide the list in half
        continue until we have singleton lists
        combine them by doing a merge of the sublists
        O(n)operations at each level
        log n
        n log n
    hashing:
        assign a numeric or alphanumeric string to (a piece of data) by applying a function whose output values are all the same number of bits in length
        collection of integers
        O(1)
        traded space for time
        hard to create
    rabin-karp algorithm:
        proceeds by computing, at each position of the text, the hash value of a string starting at that position with the same length as the pattern
    exceptions:
        an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions
        unhandled exceptions
        handled exceptions
    polymorphic:
        allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times
    exception vs assert?:
        pre-condition
        post-condition
    assert:
        enables you to test your assumptions about your program

O(n) - order n (an approximation of the duration of the algorithm given N input elements)
O(1) - order 1 (Constant time) and (means that it takes a constant time to run an algorithm, regardless of the size of the input)
log n - log(n) (logarithmic time complexity) (when an algorithm has O(log n) running time, it means that as the input size grows, the number of operations grows very slowly)
O(nlogn) - nlog n(implies that logn operations will occur n times)

definitions for lesson title subjects:
    divide and conquer methods:
        involves breaking up a large problem into smaller,
        solvable subproblems, solving each of the subproblems,
        and combining the solutions of the subproblems to achieve the overall solution to the main problem
    merge sort:
        continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item,
        then merges those sublists into a sorted list
    exceptions:
        an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions
