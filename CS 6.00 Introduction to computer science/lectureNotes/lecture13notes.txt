        memoization:
            record a value the first time it is computed,
            then look it up the subsequent times it is needed
        table lookup:
            an array of data that maps input values to output values, thereby approximating a mathematical function
    optimal substructure:
        global optimal solutions can be constructed from optimal solutions to sub-problems

definitions of subjects in the title:
    overlapping subproblems:
        In computer science, a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems
        which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over
        rather than always generating new subproblems.
    optimal substructure:
        if the optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using the optimal solution to its subproblems\
        instead of trying every possible way to solve the subproblems
