notes on the board:
    stockastic vs deterministic:
        deterministic simulations should get the same solution everytime it is run
        stockastic should differ from run to run because there is an element of randomness
    static vs dynamic:
        in dynamic situations time plays a role as things evolve over time
        static situations have no issue of time
    queing networks(popular example of a dynamic situation):
        models where customers (service requests) arrive at service stations (servers) to be served in a queue
    discrete simulation:
        a method of simulating the behaviour and performance of a real-life process, facility or system
    continuous simulation:
        refers to simulation approaches where a system is modeled with the help of variables
        that change continuously according to a set of differential equations
    monte carlo simulation(inferential statistics):
        a mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
        computer programs use this method to analyze past data
        and predict a range of future outcomes based on a choice of action
    inferential statistics:
        uses statistical techniques to extrapolate information from a smaller sample
        to make predictions and draw conclusions about a larger population.
        random sample tends to exhibit same properties as the population from which it was drawn.
    

definitions of the subjects in the lesson title:
    monte carlo simulations:
        a mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
        computer programs use this method to analyze past data
        and predict a range of future outcomes based on a choice of action
    estimating pi:
        the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
